On February 3, 2024, ten fourth-year students presented their undergraduate theses at a presentation meeting, and on February 6, 2024, three second-year master's students presented at a master's thesis public hearing. This was the first presentation since the Faculty of Information Science and Engineering moved to OIC. After the master's thesis public hearing, we held a celebration party where we praised each other's efforts. We look forward to everyone's future development! Thank you for your hard work!
